FIWARE IoT Stack allows you to connect devices and receive data, integrating all 
device protocols and connectivity methods, understanding and interpreting relevant information. 
It isolates data processing and application service layers from the device and network complexity, 
in terms of access, security and network protocols.

## Benefits

Benefits of solutions 'powered by the IoT Platform':

- Simple sensor data integration 
- Device-independent APIs for quick app development & lock-in prevention
- Modular
- Scalable. High available
- Open & standards based. FIWARE compliant

## APIs available 

IoT Platform provides the following APIs:

- '''Authentication API''': allows to login 
- Device API: allows managing devices, sending data from the device and receive commands and the device.
- Data API: allows recieving data stored at the FIWARE IoT Stack.
- Historic data API: allows 
- Data Processing API: allows
