The Complex Event Processing API allows you to analyze data from your IoT device and trigger actions.

This API allows you for example to define rules to trigger email notifications based on the data value thresholds or the the lack of updates from a certain device.

These rules are expressed as an EPL sentence. EPL is a domain language of Esper, the engine for processing events used. This EPL sentence matches an incoming event if satisfies the conditions and generates an "action-event" that will be sent back to FIWARE IoT Stack to execute the associated action. 

Remember you can always use the [Management Portal](portal.md) to define basic rules, which are a perfect fit for most frequent use cases.
